### Project Description
This C++ project simulates an Emergency Services Response System to certain events occuring in the "world". Once a victim is created, an event is defined, and the appropriate response team (and relevant vehicles and resources) is allocated to the emergency.
What occurs is the creation and destruction (respone to) needs simulated by the program.
